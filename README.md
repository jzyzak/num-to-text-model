# Number to Text Converter

This is a short ML Random Forest Regressor model using TF-IDF vectorization and a pipeline. Given a number as input, the model will output the word/text version of that number. This was created for a timed technical challenge for a research organization.

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model that converts numerical input into its textual representation. For example, given the input "42", the model would output "forty-two".

## Features

- Utilizes Random Forest Regressor for prediction
- Implements TF-IDF vectorization for text processing
- Employs a scikit-learn pipeline for streamlined data flow

## Requirements

- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- num2words
